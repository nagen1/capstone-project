    "As a part of the IBM Data Science professional program Capstone Project, we worked on the real datasets to get an experience of what a data scientist goes through in real life. Main objectives of this project were to define a business problem, look for data in the web and, use Foursquare location data to find out how many coffee shops in a Seattle neighborhood and figure out the suitable location for starting a new Coffee Shop business. In this project, we will go through all the process in a step by step manner from problem designing, data preparation to final analysis and finally will provide a conclusion that can be leveraged by the business stakeholders to make their decisions."

Seattle is the northernmost large city in the United States.\n",

    "In this project we will go through step by step process to make a decision whether it is a good idea to open a Coffee Shop. We analyze the neighborhoods in Seattle to identify the most profitable area since the success of the Coffee Shop depends on the location. Since we already know the coffee business in US is growing significantly, people love to start mornings with Coffee and it's an all seasons business. It is a worth figure out and good idea to start the Coffee Shop here, but we just need to make sure whether it is a profitable idea or not. If so, where we can place it, so it yields more profit to the owner."
